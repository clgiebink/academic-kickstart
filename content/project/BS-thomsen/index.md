In order to understand ecological response to climate change, it is important not only to understand speciesâ€™ responses to changing temperature, precipitation, etc., but also responses to changes in species interactions. Suttle, Thomsen and Power (2007) investigated these two effects in a California prairie system, where plots were exposed to water treatments based on multiple climate change projections for five years. They demonstrated the strong influence of species interactions on community-level response to changing climate. One watering treatment favored nitrogen-fixing forbs in the first year, which facilitated the annual grasses to outcompete other plant functional groups in subsequent years. Feedbacks and species interactions reversed initial species-level responses to changing climate. To disentangle the effect of nitrogen-fixing forbs, the watering treatments were continued for another five years with the addition of randomized removal of nitrogen-fixing forbs on plots. In collaboration with [Dr. Meredith Thomsen](http://websites.uwlax.edu/mthomsen/index.htm), I statistically analyzed the data to determine how precipitation and nitrogen availability affect the biomass of several plant functional groups.
