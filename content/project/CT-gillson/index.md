Cape Town, South Africa is home to the fynbos biome, which has high plant diversity as well as high endemicity. Invasive species, which can competitively exclude native plant species, however, threaten fynbos biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. On the University of Cape Town (UCT) campus, alien pines were introduced and naturalized and now cover what is known as the UCT forest and dam area, which was historically fynbos vegetation. I assessed the cultural, regulating, provisioning, and supporting services of the UCT forest, taking into consideration student, faculty and staff opinions via a survey. Based on the results of the assessment, I proposed a management plan that would increase biodiversity and maximize ecosystem services of the UCT forest and dam area.
