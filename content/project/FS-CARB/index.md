There has been growing interest, with regards to California Air Resources Board&#39;s (CARB) Compliance Offset Protocol U.S. Forest Projects (Forest Protocol), to supplement and/or replace mandated field measurements with remotely-sensed data to estimate project carbon stocks. In this report, an array of remote sensing technologies and methods used to estimate forest biomass were reviewed and described. A selection of these remote sensing technologies and methods formed a matrix of approaches used to compile estimates of aboveground (live and standing dead tree) biomass density across spatial scales for a particular study area. An estimate compiled without the use of auxiliary data was used to assess the utility of the selected remotely-sensed data and methods. With the caveat that results are specific to the study, we found a source of remotely-sensed data that consistently outperformed, in terms of precision, other selected sources of remotely-sensed data, while a particular method for estimation did not. Better understanding the precision of estimates of aboveground biomass density obtained from these technologies, data products, and methods will assist CARB in evaluating whether a particular technology, data product, and/or method, when used at a specific scale, and for a specific purpose, is appropriate and conforms to the Forest Protocol requirements.
