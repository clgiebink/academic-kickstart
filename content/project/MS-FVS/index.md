Globally, about a third of anthropogenic carbon emissions are estimated to be sequestered in forests (Le Quéré), yet projections of the land uptake are uncertain in the face of climate change (Friedlingstein). Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is a widely used growth and yield model that uses tree and plot data to simulate growth, mortality, and response to treatments for forest stands to inform management decisions. Although a climate extension of FVS modifies forest development based on spatial species distribution models, the current version of FVS lacks the direct effect of climate variation on diameter growth. I use the climate response recorded in tree rings, complemented by inventory data from the ecologically unbiased Interior West-Forest Inventory and Analysis (IW-FIA) program to parameterize the diameter growth for several species in the Utah variant of FVS. While tree rings have long been a tool that foresters use to assess tree growth, the climate fingerprint recorded in tree rings has never been incorporated into stand-level growth and yield models. Combining tree rings and forest inventory data allows me to parse the multiple drivers of tree growth and forest stand development, such as climate, competition, and site characteristics. We expect the inclusion of climate in the diameter growth models will provide more accurate projections, allowing foresters to anticipate stand vulnerability to climate change and adaptively manage to increase stand resilience.
